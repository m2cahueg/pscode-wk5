// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

AddendA = Input
AddendB = Input

SumA = AddendA + AddendB

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

Number1 = Input

If Number1 % 2 = 0
print "The number is even."
else 
print "The number is odd."

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

Number1 = Input
Number2 = Input
Number3 = Input
Number4 = Input
Number5 = Input

Sum = Number1 + Number2 + Number3 + Number4 + Number5
Average = Sum / 5

SmallestNumber = Number1

If SmallestNumber > Number2
then SmallestNumber = Number2

If SmallestNumber > Number3
then SmallestNumber = Number3

If SmallestNumber > Number4
then SmallestNumber = Number4

If SmallestNumber > Number5
then SmallestNumber = Number5

If LargestNumber < Number2
then LargestNumber = Number2

If LargestNumber < Number3
then LargestNumber = Number3

If LargestNumber < Number4
then LargestNumber = Number4

If LargestNumber < Number5
then LargestNumber = Number5

print "The average of the five numbers is Average"
print "The smallest number of the five numbers is SmallestNumber"
print "The largest number of the five numbers is LargestNumber"
